## 🌟 Overview
The `topsis_pre_trained_models` project applies the **TOPSIS** (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to evaluate and select the best pre-trained models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including:

- **Text Summarization**
- **Text Generation**
- **Text Classification**
- **Text Conversational**
- **Text Sentence Similarity**

## 🎯 Purpose
In the rapidly evolving field of NLP, selecting the most effective pre-trained model can be challenging due to the variety of available models and their differing performance metrics. This project facilitates the comparison of these models using TOPSIS, allowing researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions based on performance metrics.

## 🛠️ Supported Tasks
| Task                    | Description                                                                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Text Summarization**  | Evaluates models that condense lengthy texts into concise summaries while preserving key information. |
| **Text Generation**     | Assesses models capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on prompts. |
| **Text Classification** | Compares models that categorize text into predefined classes or labels.             |
| **Text Conversational**| Evaluates models designed to understand and generate human-like responses in a conversation. |
| **Text Sentence Similarity** | Compares models that assess how similar two sentences are based on their meanings.   |
