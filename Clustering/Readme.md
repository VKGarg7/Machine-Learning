## 🌟 Overview

This repository delves into various **clustering algorithms** in machine learning, providing implementations and insights into their applications. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points based on inherent similarities, revealing hidden patterns without predefined labels. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to offer a hands-on understanding of clustering algorithms, enabling users to:

- Explore different clustering techniques.
- Understand their underlying mechanisms.
- Apply these algorithms to real-world datasets.
- Visualize and interpret clustering results.

| Algorithm                   | Description                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **K-Means Clustering**      | Partitions data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **Hierarchical Clustering** | Builds nested clusters by either merging or splitting them successively.                  |
| **DBSCAN**                  | Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise; groups together closely packed points and marks as outliers the points that lie alone in low-density regions. |
| **Gaussian Mixture Models** | Assumes data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions and clusters accordingly. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
